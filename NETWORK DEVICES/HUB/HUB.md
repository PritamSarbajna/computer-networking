# About:

## **Basic Features of Hub Network:**
- **_Always Broadcast_**: Hub always broadcasts the data, whatever computer will connect
with the hub, it will broadcast data to all those computers.

- **_Half-duplex Communication:_** Hub can communicate only in the half-duplex mode. Only
one computer can transmit data at a particular time, if other computers want to transmit
data, then it has to wait.
Other computers can not send data at the same time. If another computer sends data at
the same time, the message will collide from both computers.

- **_Single Colision Domain:_** Hub works on a single collision domain means Two PCs
cannot send data at the same time if they send data at the same time, the packets will
collide with each other and the packet destroys.

- **_Use only local network:_** Hub network is used only in the local network means you can
use this network in your home or in a small department, etc. This hub network cannot be
used in larger networks.

- **_Cannot store MAC:_** It is not an intelligent device. It cannot store the MAC address of
computers. It does not maintain any kind of table.
